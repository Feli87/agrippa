Agrippa is a humble CLI, whose purpose is to assist React developers in creating components without the boilerplate.
It can easily generate templates for React components of different compositions (styling solutions, prop validations, etc.) and in different environments.

## v1.3.0

**Agrippa v1.3.0 is officially out!** <br/>
The new version introduces some cool new features:
- A new feature, `separate-index`, improves the generated component structure by separating the component code from the index file! 
  *It improves DX by a lot, and is the new default*. We truly recommend it, but you can opt out by setting `separateIndex` to `false`.
- Added support for `react-native`! React-native projects are detected automatically, but you can also use the `react-native` flag.
- We implemented *integration tests*, as well as some unit tests. Now, we can ship new versions with more confidence!
- As always, numerous bugs were fixed.

You can find the complete release notes in the [v1.3.0 release page](https://github.com/NitzanHen/agrippa/releases/tag/v1.3.0).

To update to the new version, call `npm i -g agrippa`. 
As always, please reach out with any bugs or feedback!

## Docs 

This page contains useful information to get started with using Agrippa. 
All other documentation & guides can be found [on our wiki](https://github.com/NitzanHen/agrippa/wiki).

## Installation

```bash
npm install -g agrippa
# Or:
yarn global add agrippa
```

Alterntively, use:
```bash
npx agrippa [...]
# e.g.
npx agrippa gen top-bar 
```
using `npx`, the latest version is always used.

## Usage

Agrippa consists of two commands: `generate` (or `gen`) and `init`:

### Generate
`agrippa gen <name> [options]` is the core of the CLI - this command generates a new React component, based on the `name` and `options` passed to it.

`agrippa generate` is an alias of `agrippa gen`.

The options that `agrippa gen` accepts are listed in [The Complete List of Generation Options](https://github.com/NitzanHen/agrippa/wiki/The-Complete-List-of-Generation-Options), on our [wiki](https://github.com/NitzanHen/agrippa/wiki).

### Init
`agrippa init` generates a basic `.agripparc.json` file, with some default values for options that agrippa accepts.  

## Using a config
In most projects, some options repeat themselves on most, if not all, components of the app. For example, if the codebase uses CSS modules as a styling solution, then the majority of component would be generated with `--styling css`. 

To avoid this unnecessary boilerplate, an `.agripparc.json` config file can be used. It's dead simple to set up! simply call `agrippa init` at the root of your project, or create an empty `.agripparc.json` file, and edit its contents to match the desired defaults. <br/>
The config file's options are the same as the CLI's. The latter's options take precedence over the former's, which is useful for overriding the project's defaults when needed.

## Community

My ambition is that Agrippa would become a tool that makes the lives of React developers easier, but perhaps more importantly one that they enjoy using. The tool's ease-of-use at the practical level is one aspect of that, but just as important is the cultivation of an active, positive community around it that developers feel welcome in.

Therefore, your thoughts, suggestions and collaboration are *most welcome!* <br/>
If you like Agrippa and want to see it grow, please spread its word! (and give it a ‚≠ê)
