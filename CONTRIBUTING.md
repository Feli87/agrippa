First things first, thank you for your interest in contributing to Agrippa! ✨✨

You can contribute to Agrippa in a few ways:

# Spreading the word

**The easiest way to help Agrippa as a project is to spread its word!** If you like Agrippa, tell your (dev) friends & family about it or write a post about it on Twitter or elsewhere. It would be really appreciated, will help Agrippa grow, and will hopefully be useful to others too!

Also, if you're using Agrippa in a cool or creative way, do tell about it!! Especially if it's something that can help other users too.

Lastly, the wiki has a small list of [articles about Agrippa](https://github.com/NitzanHen/agrippa/wiki#posts--articles). If you happen to be an author of such an article, a tutorial or something similar, I'd be more than happy to add your post to that list! 

# Reporting bugs

If you've encountered unexpected behaviour, please:

1. If you're trying to generate a component, please try running the same command with the `--debug` flag, and inspecting the output. It will print additional useful data (such as the parsed config, steps that succeeded, warnings, etc.) which in most cases help you identify a mistake on your part or a bug in Agrippa. 

> If you're unsure whether the command you used is valid or not, please [consult the docs](https://github.com/NitzanHen/agrippa/wiki). If you find something in the docs unclear or noncomprehensive, please [open an issue](https://github.com/NitzanHen/agrippa/issues) about it! 

2. If the odd behaviour persists, and it seems like a bug on Agrippa's end, please [open an issue](https://github.com/NitzanHen/agrippa/issues) on GitHub. Make sure you describe the problem clearly, provide steps to reproduce and paste the debug logs (if applicable), as well as any other information that you think could help. It makes debugging easier and the problem will likely be fixed sooner. 

3. If the bug is fixed, an "unstable" version of Agrippa will likely be published soon after. It *does not* replace the `latest` production version, and can instead be installed with `npm i -g agrippa@next` (or an equivalent with `yarn` or `npx` command). Please test it out, and make sure the behaviour is back to normal!

# Other contributions

This section includes, but is not limited to, the following cases:

- You want to suggest a feature (and perhaps help implement it)
- You find something is missing from the docs, or not explained clearly
- You find a typo or any error in the `--help` info, the code itself or the repo

In that case, the first thing you should do is [open an issue](https://github.com/NitzanHen/agrippa/issues) about it! Let's discuss it.

If you've found an error, please provide any information you think might be relevant. <br/>
If you have an idea, please describe as best as you can *what* the idea is, and *why* you think it's a good idea; different people see the world differently, and I want to understand your perspective!

In any case, thanks a lot for your contribution!!
